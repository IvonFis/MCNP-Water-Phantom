Water Phantom simulation with MCNP for PDD and OAR's simulations with a 0.5 cm^3 detector size. The \*F8 tally for the average energy deposited in a tally cell per source particle in MeV was used. To calculate de absorbed dose in every cell, it is necessary to divide the result of the energy stored by the cell mass; the cell mass information is provided in table 30 of the output MCNP information.
